# WaitingRoomApp

Dear future employer,

I am honored by your interest in my GitHub profile.
You are probably here because I mention this app in my resume letter.
Since this cross-platform application is the main product of my company NAIT UG (haftungsbeschr√§nkt), the code is private.

NAIT aims to get rid of long waiting times at the doctor's office and runs on [web](https://nait.app), [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/nait/id1513714236) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nait.android&hl=en_GB)

Please visit our [landing page](https://nait.io) for more information.
