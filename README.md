# WaitingRoomApp

Dear future employer,

I am honored by your interest in my GitHub profile.
You are probably here because I mention this app in my resume letter.
Since I am hoping to one day create a business out of this app, the code is private.
However, if you are interested in seeing the code or try out the app (only possible on android devices, ios coming soon)
just write me an email and I will send you the APK file to try out the app and temporarily set the 'real' waiting-room repo to public.
